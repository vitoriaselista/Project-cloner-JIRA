# **Jira Project Cloner**

The Jira Project Cloner is a Python script designed to facilitate the cloning of projects, along with their associated schemes, using the Jira Software API's.

## Features

### Clone entire projects: 
The script allows you to clone projects from one Jira Software instance to another, preserving all project configurations, issue types, workflows, and other associated settings.

### Scheme cloning: 
In addition to project cloning, the script also ensures that associated schemes, such as issue type schemes, workflow schemes, and screen schemes, are accurately replicated in the cloned project.

### Automated process: 
With a simple configuration and execution process, the script automates the otherwise manual and time-consuming task of cloning projects and their schemes.


## Prerequisites


    Python 3.x installed on your system
    Access to a Jira Software instance with administrative privileges
    Jira Software API credentials (API token & username/password)

## Installation
    
    Clone the repository or download the script directly to your local machine.

    Install the required Python packages by running the following command:

    pip install -r requirements.txt


## Configuration


Before running the script, you need to configure the following settings:

1. Open the config.py file.


2. Update the following variables with your Jira Software instance details and credentials:
        
         BASE_URL: The base url of your Jira instance
         
         YOUR_PROJECT_KEY: The key of the source project you want to clone
         
         NEW_PROJECT_NAME: The name of your new project
         
         NEW_PROJECT_KEY: Set the key of the new project

         YOUR_USER/EMAIL: Your Atlassian account user

         API_TOKEN: Your Jira Software API token or password

## Usage

    Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the script.

    Run the following command to start the project cloning process:

    python clone_projects.py

    The script will initiate the cloning process and provide progress updates in the terminal.

    Once the script completes, the cloned project, including its associated schemes, will be available in your Jira Software instance.
    

## Notes

This script is intended for **administrative** use and requires appropriate permissions to clone projects and modify schemes.

Ensure that you have valid backup mechanisms in place before executing this script, as it performs irreversible changes to your Jira Software instance.

! Permission schemes are not available in free plans, if you have a free plan, you will need to edit this variable inside the clone_projects.py, one easy is way to do this is just adding a # in front of the variable in line 105, then run the code normally.
